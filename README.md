### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mike. I am a software developer with several years of experience in Python programming. I specialize in web development, using popular frameworks such as Flask, Django, and fastAPI. I am currently expanding my skills by learning JavaScript and React. 

Here's a glimpse into my current focus:
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m continuously learning JS and React
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on [my-py](https://my-py.ru/), a project that showcases my skills as a web developer

Take a look at some of my web projects:
1. [Flask blog](https://flask-blog.my-py.ru/)
2. [English App (Flask)](https://english-coach.my-py.ru/)
3. [To-Do List (Django)](https://tododjango.my-py.ru/)
